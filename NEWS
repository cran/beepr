pingr 1.1
===========

* beep() throws a warning instead of an error if no working audio interface is found. The rationale for this is that it would be worse if a long analysis was aborted due to the notification system failing rather than to not throw a proper error.

pingr 1.0
===========

* Added the possibility to use `paplay` to play audio on Linux.
* Changed the priority for which audio program is used first on Linux. `paplay` and `aplay` is now tried first and VLC is used as the last resort.
* It is now possible to play any wav-file using `ping("my_wav_fil.wav")`

pingr 0.1
===========

* Intial release.
